  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.
  config.vm.box = "box-cutter/oel65"

  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
  # config.vm.box_check_update = false

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

  # If true, then any SSH connections made will enable agent forwarding.
  # Default value: false
  config.ssh.forward_agent = true

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.
  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  #   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  # end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

    # More info on http://fgrehm.viewdocs.io/vagrant-cachier/usage

    # OPTIONAL: If you are using VirtualBox, you might want to use that to enable
    # NFS for shared folders. This is also very useful for vagrant-libvirt if you
    # want bi-directional sync

    #  type: :nfs,
      # The nolock option can be useful for an NFSv3 client that wants to avoid the
      # NLM sideband protocol. Without this option, apt-get might hang if it tries
      # to lock files needed for /var/cache/* operations. All of this can be avoided
      # by using NFSv4 everywhere. Please note that the tcp option is not the default.
    #  mount_options: ['rw', 'vers=3', 'tcp', 'nolock']
